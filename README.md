# jk_SubtitleImport
After Effects script for importing SRT subtitles.

## How to use
Create a text layer template - subtitles will have the same formatting.
Select it.
Run the script.
Select SRT file.
Enjoy. Or [report a bug](https://github.com/Issity/jk_SubtitleImport/issues/new) if it didn't work.

## Why it's useful
Well... It's rather obvious. If have SRT subtitles and want to put them in your video, you just use this script instead of trying to find someone who would copy all that text into AE and manually adjust timings in exchange for some moneys.

## Features
- multi-line subs can be aligned to top/bottom/center
- text keyframes can be placed at exact time (between video frames) or aligned to video frames (different methods available)
- (option) extend comp if subs are longer
- (option) warn if subs are longer than comp

## Disclaimer
This script is very rough, created for my own needs. There's only minimal error checking. Script may crash if used in unexpected manner.
If it's useful for you too - that's great.

## Found a bug? Want a feature?
You can report a bug or suggest a feature by creating a [New Issue](https://github.com/Issity/jk_SubtitleImport/issues/new).
I might do something with it but won't promise.

_Live long and prosper!_
